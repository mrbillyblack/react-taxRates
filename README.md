# react-taxRates

## Background:
Something small I put together to understand React.JS. This small program does two things:

</br>• Calculate your income tax rate based on your bracket (hypothetically, as this is just a test program)
</br>• Use the chart.js react libary to give us a look at marginal tax rates throughout the years in US History. (data from TurboTax, input manually into JSON)
</br>• This uses the taxRates data set from my SQL parser (https://github.com/wmmcguire/sql-parser)

### To run, use <b>create-react-project</b>, then import and add this as a jsx component to your App.js as /Rates.
